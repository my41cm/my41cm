Payday loans are a type of short-term cash advance loan that is often set to be due on (or shortly after) your next payday, meaning they usually last two to four weeks. Payday loans can be a strong temptation for many poor credit borrowers because they offer quick money — often almost immediate — without a lot of credit-related hassle.

But like most things that sound too good to be true, payday loans aren’t a good answer for most financial problems. Payday loans can mean a heap of trouble down the line if you can’t muster the funds to repay them. And that means all the funds plus fees, which is the first major downside of payday loans.
